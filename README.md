# Coffee-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
📘 Project Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive sales performance analysis for Maven Roasters, designed to uncover patterns in customer behavior, store performance, and product trends.
Using Microsoft Excel, I created an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore how sales vary by day, hour, product category, and location — providing clear, data-driven insights for business decisions.

The analysis answers the following key business questions:

How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?

Are there any peak times for sales activity?

What is the total sales revenue for each month?

How do sales vary across different store locations?

What is the average price/order per person?

Which products are the best-selling in terms of both quantity and revenue?
